## The Problem: Information Overload
For college students, our lives are run on WhatsApp. But critical tasks, assignments, and deadlines from classes and project groups get buried under hundreds of messages every day. Manually tracking everything is stressful and leads to missed deadlines.

## The Solution: A Single Ping for Your Plan
**PingPlan** is an intelligent assistant that lives right inside WhatsApp. Instead of manually creating a to-do list, you simply **forward any message containing a task** to the PingPlan bot. Our AI does the rest, turning unstructured chat into an organized, actionable plan.

## üöÄ Live Demo
**This is the most important part of the README.** It's a quick showcase of PingPlan in action.
